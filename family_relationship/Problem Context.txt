Problem Context
---------------
Our story is set in the planet of Lengaburu......in the distant, distant galaxy of Tara B. And our protagonists are King Shan, Queen Anga & their family. 

King Shan is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu, you see!). Let’s write some code to get to know the family.


Model out the Shan family tree so that when given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’ as an input, the output are the people that correspond to the relationship. 

Simple, right? But remember.. our evaluation is based not only on getting the right output, but on how you've written your code


Sample input & output
Input: Person = Ish; Relation = Brothers 
Expected Output: Chit, Vich
